## 📌 Program Overview

The **ProDev Backend Engineering** track is a rigorous, industry-aligned training program that focuses on backend system design and development using real-world tools and workflows. The goal is to train backend engineers who can build scalable APIs, manage data efficiently, and deploy reliable systems.

Over the course of the program, I have:
- Built RESTful and GraphQL APIs
- Managed PostgreSQL and Redis databases
- Developed background task workers using Celery and RabbitMQ
- Containerized apps with Docker
- Automated tests and deployment pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Collaborated with frontend learners using real APIs

## 📚 Core Backend Concepts

Here’s an in-depth overview of the backend topics and concepts I mastered during the program:

### 🔹 RESTful APIs
- Built modular APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Applied serializers, viewsets, routers, and permissions
- Implemented pagination, filtering, rate limiting, and versioning

### 🔹 GraphQL APIs
- Built query/mutation schemas using Graphene-Django
- Implemented nested object fetching and filtering
- Learned to manage resolver performance and query complexity

### 🔹 Database Design & PostgreSQL
- Normalized database schema (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Used foreign keys, indexes, constraints, and transactions
- Practiced data modeling and used ER diagrams
- Optimized queries using Django ORM + raw SQL

### 🔹 Asynchronous Programming
- Used Celery + RabbitMQ to queue and run background jobs
- Created scheduled tasks (periodic emails, data sync)
- Handled retry policies, error logging, and long-running processes

### 🔹 Caching Strategies
- Implemented low-level and template-level caching with Redis
- Used `@cache_page` and custom cache logic for performance
- Handled cache invalidation and data freshness

### 🔹 CI/CD Pipelines
- Built GitHub Actions workflows to automate:
  - Unit testing on PRs
  - Code linting
  - Docker build + deploy
- Simulated production environments using `.env` files and Docker volumes

### 🔹 Security and Best Practices
- Applied authentication using JWT and token blacklisting
- Used role-based access control (RBAC)
- Implemented input validation, CORS headers, CSRF protection
- Secured endpoints with custom permissions and middleware

## 🔍 Real-World Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                                         | Solution                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JWT token expiration during async requests       | Implemented refresh tokens and graceful token refresh flow               |
| Docker containers couldn't connect to DB         | Used Docker Compose with `depends_on` and wait-for-db script             |
| PostgreSQL performance dropped with large joins  | Optimized with `select_related()` and added indexes                      |
| Celery tasks failing silently                    | Configured proper logging, error handling, and retry settings            |
| CI tests failed due to missing environment vars  | Created `.env.test` and secret handling in GitHub Actions                |
| Testing email sending in development             | Used Mailtrap and Django's in-memory email backend for sandbox testing   |
| Collaborating with frontend on changing schemas  | Documented all APIs with Swagger and updated frontend via shared docs    |

## ✅ Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

Throughout the program, I adopted the following key practices:

### ✅ Version Control
- Used feature branches and atomic commits
- Opened pull requests for review and history tracking

### ✅ Documentation
- Wrote Markdown-based developer guides
- Maintained Swagger and Postman collections for API users

### ✅ Code Quality
- Followed PEP8, used linters and formatters (black, flake8)
- Modularized apps, used serializers and services pattern
- Wrote unit and integration tests for coverage

### ✅ Collaboration
- Practiced writing clear commit messages and PR titles
- Worked with frontend learners to align on API changes
- Helped debug issues and proposed improvements in group chats

### ✅ Real-World Readiness
- Approached projects like products, not just code
- Prioritized performance, security, and maintainability
- Learned to Google better, troubleshoot faster, and plan smarter

# Nexus Job Board Backend

## Overview
This is the backend for the Job Board platform built for Project Nexus (ProDev BE). Features include:
- Role-based JWT authentication (employers vs job seekers)
- Job posting & categorization
- Job applications
- Swagger/OpenAPI interactive documentation
- Optimized queries (`select_related`) and future-ready indexing

---

## Quick Start (with Docker)

```bash
# Build and bring up containers
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d

# Apply migrations (if not already done)
docker-compose exec web python3 manage.py makemigrations
docker-compose exec web python3 manage.py migrate
```
## Authentication Flow
### 1. Register a user

#### Job seeker:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"seeker_example","password":"StrongPass123","email":"s@example.com","is_job_seeker":true}'
```

#### Employer:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/users/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"employer_example","password":"StrongPass123","email":"e@example.com","is_employer":true}'
```
### 2. Obtain JWT tokens
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/token/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"seeker_example","password":"StrongPass123"}'
```
#### Response:
```json
{
  "refresh": "<refresh_token>",
  "access": "<access_token>"
}
```

### 3. Use access token in requests
Set header:

```makefile
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```
#### Example: get seeker’s applications

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/applications/seeker/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

## Core API Examples
### Create Category (employer or admin)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/categories/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <employer_access_token>" \
  -d '{"name":"Backend","slug":"backend"}'
```
### List Categories
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/categories/
```

### Create Job (employer)

    "company_name":"NexusCorp",
    "location":"Remote",
    "employment_type":"full_time",

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/applications/apply/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <seeker_access_token>" \
  -d '{
    "job": 1,
    "cover_letter": "I am very interested in this role.",
    "resume_url": "https://example.com/resume.pdf"
  }'
```
### Employer view applications
