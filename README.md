## 📌 Program Overview

The **ProDev Backend Engineering** track is a rigorous, industry-aligned training program that focuses on backend system design and development using real-world tools and workflows. The goal is to train backend engineers who can build scalable APIs, manage data efficiently, and deploy reliable systems.

Over the course of the program, I have:
- Built RESTful and GraphQL APIs
- Managed PostgreSQL and Redis databases
- Developed background task workers using Celery and RabbitMQ
- Containerized apps with Docker
- Automated tests and deployment pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Collaborated with frontend learners using real APIs

## 📚 Core Backend Concepts

Here’s an in-depth overview of the backend topics and concepts I mastered during the program:

### 🔹 RESTful APIs
- Built modular APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Applied serializers, viewsets, routers, and permissions
- Implemented pagination, filtering, rate limiting, and versioning

### 🔹 GraphQL APIs
- Built query/mutation schemas using Graphene-Django
- Implemented nested object fetching and filtering
- Learned to manage resolver performance and query complexity

### 🔹 Database Design & PostgreSQL
- Normalized database schema (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Used foreign keys, indexes, constraints, and transactions
- Practiced data modeling and used ER diagrams
- Optimized queries using Django ORM + raw SQL

### 🔹 Asynchronous Programming
- Used Celery + RabbitMQ to queue and run background jobs
- Created scheduled tasks (periodic emails, data sync)
- Handled retry policies, error logging, and long-running processes

### 🔹 Caching Strategies
- Implemented low-level and template-level caching with Redis
- Used `@cache_page` and custom cache logic for performance
- Handled cache invalidation and data freshness

### 🔹 CI/CD Pipelines
- Built GitHub Actions workflows to automate:
  - Unit testing on PRs
  - Code linting
  - Docker build + deploy
- Simulated production environments using `.env` files and Docker volumes

### 🔹 Security and Best Practices
- Applied authentication using JWT and token blacklisting
- Used role-based access control (RBAC)
- Implemented input validation, CORS headers, CSRF protection
- Secured endpoints with custom permissions and middleware

## 🔍 Real-World Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                                         | Solution                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JWT token expiration during async requests       | Implemented refresh tokens and graceful token refresh flow               |
| Docker containers couldn't connect to DB         | Used Docker Compose with `depends_on` and wait-for-db script             |
| PostgreSQL performance dropped with large joins  | Optimized with `select_related()` and added indexes                      |
| Celery tasks failing silently                    | Configured proper logging, error handling, and retry settings            |
| CI tests failed due to missing environment vars  | Created `.env.test` and secret handling in GitHub Actions                |
| Testing email sending in development             | Used Mailtrap and Django's in-memory email backend for sandbox testing   |
| Collaborating with frontend on changing schemas  | Documented all APIs with Swagger and updated frontend via shared docs    |

## ✅ Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

Throughout the program, I adopted the following key practices:

### ✅ Version Control
- Used feature branches and atomic commits
- Opened pull requests for review and history tracking

### ✅ Documentation
- Wrote Markdown-based developer guides
- Maintained Swagger and Postman collections for API users

### ✅ Code Quality
- Followed PEP8, used linters and formatters (black, flake8)
- Modularized apps, used serializers and services pattern
- Wrote unit and integration tests for coverage

### ✅ Collaboration
- Practiced writing clear commit messages and PR titles
- Worked with frontend learners to align on API changes
- Helped debug issues and proposed improvements in group chats

### ✅ Real-World Readiness
- Approached projects like products, not just code
- Prioritized performance, security, and maintainability
- Learned to Google better, troubleshoot faster, and plan smarter
